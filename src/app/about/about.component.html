  Founded in 2020 by four computer science students, Click4fit has come a long way from its beginnings in Greece. When the students first started out, their passion for training and fitness drove them to do tons of research about so that Click4fit can offer to users how to stay fit and train easily. We now serve customers all over the country, and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website.
